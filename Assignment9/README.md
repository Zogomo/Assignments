# Description

This Program will take an argument to create a randomized integer array 
with values ranging 0 to 100 and then merge sort it.
If no argument is given, will ask for a file name to read an array from 
and then sort the given array.

## instructions

If you desire a random array, open with an argument giving the size of 
the array as an integer.
When prompted give the name of the file you want the randomized array in.
Then you should be prompted to give the name of the file you want the 
sorted array in.

If you have a text file with the array, given in a format of one value per 
line, run the program without an argument. 
You'll be prompted to give the file name you have your array in.
If the file is found you'll be given a prompt to enter the name
of the file you want the sorted array in.
